## 🌟 Project Vision

**FitPlan AI** is an intelligent fitness companion that revolutionizes how people approach workout planning. By leveraging cutting-edge Large Language Model (LLM) technology, it creates personalized, adaptive workout plans that evolve with your fitness journey.

### 🎯 The Problem We Solve

- **Generic Fitness Advice**: One-size-fits-all workout plans don't consider individual needs, limitations, or preferences
- **Cost Barrier**: Personal trainers are expensive and not accessible to everyone
- **Information Overload**: Too many conflicting fitness resources make it hard to know what actually works
- **Lack of Adaptation**: Static plans don't evolve as fitness levels improve or goals change

- **Personalized Plans**: Tailored workouts based on your biometrics, goals, experience level, and available equipment
- **Intelligent Adaptation**: AI-powered progression that adapts to your performance and feedback
